# Laravel Package Skeleton

This is a project skeleton which can be used for scaffolding [Laravel](https://www.laravel.com) packages using
the `composer create-project` command.

This is inspired by the [spatie/package-skeleton-laravel](https://github.com/spatie/package-skeleton-laravel) package
and uses [spatie/laravel-package-tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools) to configure the service
provider.

## Usage

To scaffold a new package run

```bash
composer create-project schildhain/laravel-package-skeleton
```

in console and answer the questions appropriate to your case. The corresponding values are replaced in each file.

## Testing

```bash
composer test
```
